# Vue Your Todos

A unique take on the TodoMVC app that is built using a custom design with:

- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=vueyourtodos-bh&utm_campaign=devex)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The codebase is a fun exploration of Vue.js 3's Composition API and is not representative of best practices or patterns. It is still a work in progress and additional changes will be coming.
